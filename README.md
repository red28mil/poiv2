I have created a Beaches of ireland app, using node.js, HTML, Handlebars, Hapi(inert, vision, cookie, axios, joi, boom,) Mongodb, Mongoose,chai@mocha.
I started using vs code but ran into some trouble when i was changing my html pages to Handlebars so i started my project again in webstorm instead.I have found dthis easier to use for this project but i had some issues with my mongodb install and use of mongoose which took quite some time to resolve, i understand that i was setting up a new connection everytiime i connected instead of calling the one same db everytime to save my data. I could add api and get data but my fetch data would only work on html page even tough i spent alot of time studying fetching data in node. I have implemented login logout,map data aboout beaches and added weather data retrieval and alos left in a donate option so users could donate to clean up beaches.I have commited everything to git with branches and all changes added.
On the main page i have added a map with hardcoded beach coordinates with beach flag locaters.
when the user signsup or logins in they are brought to the main page with an embedded map of irish beaches and when they click on the location icon they can view a sidebar with pictures of said beach and  ratings and  a link.
Below this i have added a google map with search bar for users to enter a beach location thats not in my first map or just search for any location they require.
